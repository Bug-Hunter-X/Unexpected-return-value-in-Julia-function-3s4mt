# Julia Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a simple bug in a Julia function. The function `myfunction` is intended to return the square of the input if the input is greater than 10, and 0 otherwise. However, when the input is less than or equal to 10, the function returns nothing instead of 0, resulting in an unexpected output.  The solution provided addresses this issue.
